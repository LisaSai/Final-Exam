            <h3>Australia</h3>
            <h4>Island Hop on Your Own Private Yacht</h4>
            <p>The Whitsunday Islands offer some of the world&apos;s finest sailing, with mostly perfect winds, calm seas, beautiful scenery and 74 islands to hop through (69 of which are uninhabited). It&apos;s called bareboating: hiring a boat, stocking it with provisions and friends and sailing off into the sunset. Even if you have no sailing experience, companies such as Cumberland Charter Yachts will give you a yacht and a safety briefing and then set you free, with the requirement that you respond to their twice-daily radio schedule to say where you are and where you&apos;re going. Leave from the coastal town of Airlie Beach or have your vessel delivered to Hayman or Hamilton Island. </p>

            <h4>Ride a Luxury Train Across the Continent</h4>
            <p>Named after the Afghan camel drivers that used to roam Australia&apos;s centre, this unforgettable train journey takes in 2979 kilometres (1851 miles) of tropics, the mountains of the Flinders Ranges, scorched desert, Katherine Gorge and the Red Centre. The Ghan takes three days to cross the continent, from Darwin to Adelaide or vice versa, including fascinating whistlestop tours in Katherine and Alice Springs. You can also opt for a trip on the Indian Pacific, a four-day journey from Sydney to Perth or vice versa.</p>

            <h4>Enter Another World at the Pinnacles</h4>
            <p>On the Turquoise Coast of Western Australia, 250 kilometres (155 miles) north of Perth, you will find the Pinnacles Desert, where hundreds of ancient limestone pillars look like extraterrestrial tombstones. The park is fringed by secluded white beaches, wildflowers, unique fauna and excellent fishing. Stay in the nearby fishing village of Cervantes or journey up the Indian Ocean Drive to discover all the colourful beauty and incredible wildlife interactions along the way.</p>

            <h4>Take a Foodie Road Trip around Tasmania</h4>
            <p>Start with a breakfast of fresh doughnuts and bagels at the Farm Gate Market in Hobart then spend a few days feasting through Tasmania. There is lots of local produce to sample, with rarely more than an hour&apos;s drive between gourmet towns and stores. Eat apples at Willie Smith&apos;s Apple Shed, a ciderhouse turned museum in the Huon Valley&#59; just-shucked Tassie oysters at Bangor Wine &amp; Oyster Shed in Port Arthur&#59; Belgian-style chocolates at the House of Anvers near Latrobe&#59; and the triple cream brie or chilli camembert from Wicked Cheese in historic Richmond. Tasmania is famous for its cool-climate wines, and the Tamar Valley, running north from Launceston, is Tasmania&apos;s premier wine region. Don&apos;t miss the pinot noir, Tasmania&apos;s signature wine variety, from the state&apos;s oldest vineyard at Providence.</p>

            <h4>Dive with Great White Sharks in Port Lincoln</h4>
            <p>Being underwater with a great white shark (even if you are in a strengthened aluminium cage) is an adventure to tell your friends about. Calypso Star Charters and Adventure Bay Charters run one-day great white shark tours to Neptune Island, 70 kilometres (43 miles) off Port Lincoln, a 50-minute flight from Adelaide. No scuba experience is necessary (air is fed into the cage via a hose). If you&apos;re looking for something equally as memorable but without the cage, you can also swim in open ocean with the gentle but giant whale sharks on Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia between March and August.</p>

            <h4>Watch Turtles Hatch in Queensland</h4>
            <p>Watching baby turtles hatch, then make their disorientated run into the sea, is a very special bucket list experience. One of the most popular places to see marine turtles nest in Australia is at Mon Repos Conservation Park, near Bundaberg in Queensland. Between November and March rangers operate nightly guided tours on the beach. Other hotspots for catching turtle nesting and hatching include the islands of Lady Elliot, Heron and Lady Musgrave. From January onwards, witness the race to the water as the hatchlings start to push their way out of their sandy nests and scurry down to the ocean – it&apos;s quite an incredible sight.</p>
