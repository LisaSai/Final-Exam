            <h3>Stockholm</h3>
            <a href="https://www.tui.nl/reizen/zweden/stockholm/stockholm/"><img src="images/Stockholm.jfif">Book Here</a>
            <p>Stockholm offers a smorgasbord of art and culture, from world-class museums and historically fascinating royal palaces to niche galleries and intimate artist houses.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you are never far from nature in Stockholm. The Stockholm archipelago – the largest in Sweden – is a draw for visitors and locals alike. Take a ferry to one of the islands, such as the idyllic archipelago town of Vaxholm with its village-y feel, defined by wooden houses dating back to the end of the 20th century. Here, you will find a range of shops, restaurants and cafés. In the summertime, take your cue from the locals and relax by the waterfront with some homemade ice cream.</p>
